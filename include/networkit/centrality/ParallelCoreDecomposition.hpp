 * @ingroup centrality
 * Computes an exact k-core decomposition in parallel.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the online peeling framework, hierarchical bucketing structure,
 * probabilistic high-degree sampling, and vertical granularity control described by Liu et al. in
 * "Parallel k-Core Decomposition: Theory and Practice" (Proc. ACM Manag. Data 3, 3, SIGMOD
 * 2025). Sampling errors are detected and cause a restart without sampling, making the
 * implementation Las Vegas rather than Monte Carlo.
 * Low-average-degree graphs with maximum degree below the edge-parallelism threshold use
 * the existing ParK peeling implementation to avoid sampling/bucketing overhead. Selection
 * is automatic and preserves exact core numbers and normalization semantics.
 *
 * The input graph must be undirected, must not contain self-loops, and must have continuous node
 * ids. Both GraphW and zero-copy CSR-backed GraphR inputs are supported.
